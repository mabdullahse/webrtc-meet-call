# WebRTC React Client and Node.js Server

## Overview

This project is a WebRTC-based video conferencing application with a React.js client and a Node.js server using socket.io. It allows users to create and join video conferences with ease. The project leverages the power of WebRTC for real-time communication and React.js for the client-side interface.

- Real-time video and audio communication.
- React.js client with React Router and React Player.
- Node.js server with socket.io for signaling.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/webrtc-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd webrtc-project
   ```

3. Install the dependencies for both the client and server:

   ```shell
   cd client
   npm install
   cd ../server
   npm install
   ```

### Usage

1. Start the Node.js server:

   ```shell
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

   The server will run on http://localhost:3000 by default. You can configure the port in the server.js file.

2. Start the React.js client:

   ```shell
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

   The React.js client will be available at http://localhost:4000 by default.

3. Open your browser and visit http://localhost:4000 to access the application.

### Configuration

You can customize the project's configuration by modifying the following files:

- `server/config.js`: Server configuration, including the signaling server port.
- `client/src/config.js`: Client configuration, including the signaling server URL.
